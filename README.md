This is my learning and coding work on Sunshine app(Abut Sunchine app, see below).


Sunshine
========

Sunshine is the companion Android app for the Udacity course [Developing Android Apps: Android Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853).

Take the course to find out how to build this app a step at a time, and eventually create your own Android App!

This is the second version of the Sunshine code. The repository has been updated on:

* **February 13th, 2015** - Major update
* February 25, 2015 - Minor bug fixes
* March 4th, 2015 - Minor bug fixes
